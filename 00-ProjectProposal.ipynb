    "The NBA Draft Combine is a key evaluation tool for teams to assess prospective players' physical and skill-based attributes by using standardized measurements and athletic tests, like height, wingspan, vertical jump, three-quarter-court sprint, and on-court drills. (1) The draft combine results are often used to evaluate a player’s physical potential and readiness for the NBA besides the college statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Certain physical traits may provide advantages that are not fully reflected in college performance data, but it is unclear to what extent or which draft combined measurements could translate into sustained NBA success. Recent studies about NBA Draft Combine metrics have found weak or non-significant relationships between athletic test results and rookie performance indicators, including points, rebounds, and assists per game. This finding suggests that while combined data may capture athletic potential, it fails to account for intangible factors such as basketball intelligence, adaptability, and in-game decision-making, limiting its ability to predict early professional performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, other prior research has shown that draft position itself is strongly associated with long-term career outcomes; particularly the top picks tend to have significantly longer NBA careers, with career longevity decreasing as draft standing increases. (2) This shows that draft position captures teams’ overall evaluations of talent and potential and should be controlled when assessing the predictive value of pre-draft combine measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "After controlling for draft position and college performance, this project explores whether pre-draft combine measurements can predict a player’s on-court performance during the first five years of their NBA career.\n",

    "We predict that after controlling for draft position and college statistics, NBA Draft Combine athletic measurements will have limited ability to predict players performance during their first five years in the league. Prior research shows that draft position is strongly linked to career outcomes (Reference 1), while combine metrics have weak and often non significant relationships with early career performance (Reference 2). Therefore, we expect that most combined measurements will explain little additional variation in long term performance beyond what is already captured by draft order and college success. "

    "1. Explain what the **ideal** dataset you would want to answer this question. (This should include: \n",
    "   1. What variables?\n",
    "       - Body Measurements(predictors): height, hand size, wingspan, weight, shoe size\n",
    "       - College Performance/ NBA Draft (controls): Stats before the NBA draft to compare to performance after being in the NBA\n",
    "       - NBA Performance(result/target): Wins, Overall Value/impact in games, over the course of 5 years in the NBA\n",
    "   2. How many observations are needed? \n",
    "       - Around 60 players are drafted every year\n",
    "       - Dataset of approximately 1000 players to find out the correlation between body measurements and their performance\n",
    "       - 1000/60 is around 16.67 so 15 to 20 years of NBA draft picks\n",
    "   3. Who/what/how would these data be collected? \n",
    "       - NBA players have their draft combine anthrometric publicly available on their https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro website\n",
    "       - Since measurements are facts and NBA.com being public website, we can scrape the data from the official sources\n",
    "   4. How would these data be stored/organized?\n",
    "        - Data of Body Measurements, Pre-Draft performance, and NBA performance stored in relational database\n",
    "        - This allows three different datas to have the same key, connecting the datas together (no repetition of same names)\n",
    "2. Search for potential **real** datasets that could provide you with something useful for this project.  For each dataset that you find write 3-5 sentences describing \n",
    "   1. where the data is located (e.g., URL) and anything you need to do to use it (e.g., ask for permission, fill out an application)\n",
    "       - https://www.nba.com/stats/draft/combine-anthro : This website is the official NBA website which shows detailed stats about every player in the league. On the Combined Anthro stats page, each players body measurements from season 2000 - 2001 to season 2025 - 2026 required for our research is provided. Since this is public information/facts on their official source, unless used to make financial profit, we can use the data for our research.\n",
    "       - https://www.nba.com/draft/ : This is the same official NBA website but draft info section. On this page, it provides details of each years' draft prospects, draft rankings, and actual draft pick history. This information provides us with their level of performance before the draft. By comparing the performances pre and post draft, the relevancy of body measurements to performance can be tested.\n",
    "       - For NBA Performance stats, we will be looking at their regular season performances. https://www.nba.com/stats/players official NBA website in players season stats. Since Basketball is a sport with different positions, by gathering data by their rankings, their performance stats can be measured. \n",
    "   2. what the important variables are in this dataset that you might use\n",

    "\n",
    "> Since we are using a public, approved dataset, this should not be a concern.\n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data that was collected could be biased in a way that the cathlete combine result scores could be skewered by the data collectors preference on what constitutes a high score. This will be mitigated by considering other dataset results done by different data collectors, then averaging them out.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We shall anonymize this data by filtering out information that isn't relevant for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We plan to protect and secure the data by locking the access of it behind a trusted, private account.\n",

    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Potential favoritism towards certain atheletes, as well as subconscious racial biases could skewer data analysis through confirmation bias, and trying to make the data results fit in a way that favors (or even takes away) from said athletes accomplishments. This will be addresed through different people in our groups, who have opposing opinions on certain subjects, to have a proper discussion on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",

    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We will make sure to follow Goodhart's law, and not use the proxy as the opitimization target.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Once again, due to the dataset that will be extracted itself being potentially full of bias, that must be clearly communicated in order to address the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We will try and prioritize the values AND the justification behind the values of the datasets at the same time, in order to optimize our defined metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    ">We will explain the exact process in which the model was made to get the results we wanted, so the average person can understand where this sort of data came from.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift),\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?,\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
